TODO make an invokable class with this, similar to force-directed-graph, plot2d, plot3d, etc

esp so I can put my raytracer / slicer in one place

esp since now I've got earthquake-shear-lines/viz-hist-splat-volume.lua doing it

test demo here: mandelbrot set

another good one: the hydrogen wavefunction visualizer i've already got in webgl

another good one / thing to integrate: hydro-cl


Man I did this so much better 20 years ago, raytracing and everything.
