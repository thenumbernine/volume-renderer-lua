TODO make an invokable class with this, similar to force-directed-graph, plot2d, plot3d, etc

esp so I can put my raytracer / slicer in one place

esp since now I've got earthquake-shear-lines/viz-hist-splat-volume.lua doing it

test demo here: mandelbrot set

another good one: the hydrogen wavefunction visualizer i've already got in webgl

another good one / thing to integrate: hydro-cl


Man I did this so much better 20 years ago, raytracing and everything.

Other volume renderers I've written over the years:

- https://github.com/thenumbernine/EinsteinFieldEquationSolution									- render.lua is slice-based
- https://github.com/thenumbernine/efesoln-cl-lua													- slice-based
- https://github.com/thenumbernine/hydro-cl-lua														- slice-based if I remember
- https://github.com/thenumbernine/HydrodynamicsGPU													- can't remember, I think I didn't put much effort into the 3D volume display
- https://github.com/thenumbernine/wavefunction														- webgl, slice-based
- https://web.archive.org/web/20231207224139/http://www.christopheremoore.net/fractal-volumizer/	- slice-based
